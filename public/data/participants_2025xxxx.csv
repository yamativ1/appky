This has been validated by significant traction, evidenced by revenue growth and premium brand partnerships over the last 17 months. Additionally, reaching profitability and achieving breakeven highlights our ability to scale and sustain profitability with our growth plans.
 

 Some interesting facts about Smartifai and our traction, as we have made significant progress in the last 17 months of our launch.
 

 

 1) Generated $1.6M in closed revenues within 17 months of launch and we are close to reaching $2M in revenue.
 

 2) Secured 17 prestigious MMA SMARTIES Industry Awards, including the TECH PROVIDER OF THE YEAR Award
 

 3) Onboarded 40 regional and international brands as advertisers.
 Onboarded 120 regional and international publishers.
 

 4) Built our in-house product, R&D, and operations team.
 

 5) Most importantly, we reached our breakeven point in August, September, and November 2023. Since then, we have scaled our operations and increased our tech efforts to bring scale to support our revenue traction. However, last month, July 2024, we achieved an 11% net profit with a 33% Gross Profit.
  
 All of this has been achieved without any external funding or VCs to date. 
 

 Given the significant traction we’re experiencing, we are currently in discussions with MEVP, A15, Aditum VC, and Vivium Holding at the regional level, as well as international VCs such as PeakXV, and 100Unicorns to name a few with a strategic focus on supporting our global growth journey. We have secured the primary commitment from Jabbar Internet Group in UAE, MEVP & A15 Ventures."
